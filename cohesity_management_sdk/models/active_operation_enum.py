    'kUpgradeCluster' specifies that the Cluster which the Node is a part of
    is currently being upgraded to a new software package.
    'kRestartCluster' specifies that the Cluster which the Node is a part of
    is currently being restarted.
    'kCreateCluster' specifies that the Node is currently being used to
    create
    a new Cluster.
    'kExpandCluster' specifies that the Node is currently being added to a
    Cluster or being used to assist in adding another Node to a Cluster.
