    """Implementation of the 'BackupJobProto_DRToCloudParams' model.

    A Proto needed in case objects backed up by this job need to DR to cloud.
    "Fail over" signifies the mechanism to move the workload to cloud.

    Attributes:
        need_to_fail_over (bool): Whether the objects in this job will be
            failed over to cloud. In case of VMs, we need to fetch information
            about the logical volumes present on the VM. Magneto might fail
            backup of a VM in case volume information can not be fetched
            (maybe because the agent is not installed or if the VM is turned
            off etc.).  The VM will be backed up using the physical agent when
            it is running in the cloud. We might choose to backup the VM in
            the cloud using native API at a later point.  This flag makes
            sense when configuring a job to backup on-prem VMs.
