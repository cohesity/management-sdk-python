        description (string): Specifies the description of the Antivirus
            service. This could be any additional information admin might
            associate with the Antivirus service.
        icap_uri (string): Specifies the ICAP uri for this Antivirus service.
            It is of the form icap://<ip-address>[:<port>]/<service>
        tag (string): Specifies the tag of antivirus service. This is
            service-specific "cookie" sent from Antivirus server to clients
            that represents a service's current state. This tag validates that
            previous Antivirus server responses can still be considered fresh
            by an Antivirus client that may be caching them. If a change on
            the AV server invalidates previous responses, the AV server can
            invalidate portions of the Antivirus client's cache by changing
            its service tag.
        tag_id (long|int): Specifies the tag Id of antivirus service.
