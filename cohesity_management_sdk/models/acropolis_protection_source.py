    """Implementation of the 'AcropolisProtectionSource' model.

    Specifies a Protection Source in Acropolis environment.

    Attributes:
        cluster_uuid (string): Specifies the UUID of the Acropolis cluster
            instance to which this entity belongs to.
        description (string): Specifies a description about the Protection
            Source.
        mount_path (bool): Specifies whether the the VM is an agent VM. This
            is applicable to acropolis entity of type kVirtualMachine.
        name (string): Specifies the name of the Acropolis Object.
        mtype (TypeEnum): Specifies the type of an Acropolis Protection Source
            Object such as 'kPrismCentral', 'kHost', 'kNetwork', etc.
            Specifies the type of an Acropolis source entity. 'kPrismCentral'
            indicates a collection of multiple Nutanix clusters.
            'kStandaloneCluster' indicates a single Nutanix cluster.
            'kCluster' indicates a Nutanix cluster manageed by a Prism
            Central. 'kHost' indicates an Acropolis host. 'kVirtualMachine'
            indicates a Virtual Machine. 'kNetwork' indicates a Virtual
            Machine network object. 'kStorageContainer' represents a storage
            container object.
        uuid (string): Specifies the UUID of the Acropolis Object. This is
            unique within the cluster instance. Together with clusterUuid,
            this entity is unique within the Acropolis environment.
