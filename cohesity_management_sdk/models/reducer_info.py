        code (string):The code of the reducer in the specified language.
        id (int): Reduced ID generated by system. Absent when user is creating
            a new reducer. Mandatory for all other use cases.
        is_system_defined (bool): Whether the mapper is system defined.
        jar_name (string): User can write their own mapper/reducer or upload
            jar files containing mappers and reducers. If this reducer was
            part of a jar file, then this field will have the JAR name.
        jar_path (string): path of JAR in which this reducer was found. This
            is applicable only when this reducer was uploaded via JAR.
        language (int): Programming language used by the reducer.
