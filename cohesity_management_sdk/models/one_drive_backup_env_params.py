class OneDriveBackupEnvParams(object):

    """Implementation of the 'OneDriveBackupEnvParams' model.

    Message to capture any additonal backup params for OneDrive within the
    Office365 environment.

    Attributes:
        filtering_policy (FilteringPolicyProto): Proto to encapsulate the
            filtering policy for backup objects like files or directories. If
            an object is not matched by any of the 'allow_filters', it will be
            excluded in the backup. If an object is matched by one of the
            'deny_filters', it will always be excluded in the backup.
            Basically 'deny_filters' overwrite 'allow_filters' if they both
            match the same object. Currently we only support two kinds of
            filter: prefix which always starts with '/', or postfix which
            always starts with '*' (cannot be "*" only). We don't support
            regular expression right now. A concrete example is: Allow
            filters: "/" Deny filters: "/tmp", "*.mp4" Using such a policy
            will include everything under the root directory except the /tmp
            directory and all the mp4 files.
        should_backup_onedrive (bool): Specifies whether the OneDrive(s) for
            all the Office365 Users present in the protection job should be
            backed up.
