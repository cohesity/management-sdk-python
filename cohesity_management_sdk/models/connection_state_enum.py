    virtual
    machine.
    'kInaccessible' indicates that one or more configuration files are
    inacccessible.
    'kInvalid' indicates that virtual machine configuration is invalid.
    'kOrphaned' indicates that virtual machine is no longer registered on the
    host it is associated with.
    'kNotResponding' indicates that virtual machine is failed to response
    due to external issues such as network connectivity, hostd not running
    etc.
