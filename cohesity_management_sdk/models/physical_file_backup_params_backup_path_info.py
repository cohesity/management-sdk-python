class PhysicalFileBackupParamsBackupPathInfo(object):

    """Implementation of the 'PhysicalFileBackupParams_BackupPathInfo' model.

    Describes a set of files rooted under a path that need to be backed up.

    Attributes:
        exclude_paths (list of string): A list of absolute paths on the
            Physical source that should not be backed up. Any path that is a
            descendant of these paths will also be skipped.
        include_path (string): An absolute path on the Physical source that
            should be backed up. Any path that is a descendant of this path
            will also be backed up, unless (a) it is excluded from backup by
            exclude_paths below, OR (b) it belongs to a volume that is
            different from the volume include_path belongs to and there are no
            relevant paths in that volume being backed up.
        skip_nested_volumes (bool): Whether to skip any nested volumes (both
            local and network) that are mounted under 'include_path'. Note
            that if a path to a nested volume is specified as an include_path
            in another BackupPathInfo entry, that path will still get backed
            up.
