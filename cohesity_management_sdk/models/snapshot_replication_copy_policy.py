class SnapshotReplicationCopyPolicy(object):

    """Implementation of the 'SnapshotReplicationCopyPolicy' model.

    Specifies settings for copying Snapshots to Remote Clusters. This also
    specifies the retention policy that should be applied to Snapshots after
    they have been copied to the specified target.

    Attributes:
        id (string): Specified the Id for a snapshot copy policy. Thsi is
            generated when the policy is created.
        cloud_target (CloudDeployTargetDetails): Message that specifies the
            details about CloudDeploy target where backup snapshots may be
            converted and stored.
        copy_partial (bool): Specifies if Snapshots are copied from the first
            completely successful Job Run or the first partially successful
            Job Run occurring at the start of the replication schedule. If
            true, Snapshots are copied from the first Job Run occurring at the
            start of the replication schedule, even if first Job Run was not
            completely successful i.e. Snapshots were not captured for all
            Objects in the Job. If false, Snapshots are copied from the first
            Job Run occurring at the start of the replication schedule that
            was completely successful i.e. Snapshots for all the Objects in
            the Job were successfully captured.
        datalock_config (DataLockConfig): Specifies WORM retention type for the
            copy target snapshots. When a WORM retention type is specified, the
            snapshots of the Protection Groups using this policy will be kept
            for the last N days as specified in the duration of the datalock.
            During that time, the snapshots cannot be deleted.
        days_to_keep (long|int): Specifies the number of days to retain copied
            Snapshots on the target.
        multiplier (int): Specifies a factor to multiply the periodicity by,
            to determine the copy schedule. For example if set to 2 and the
            periodicity is hourly, then Snapshots from the first eligible Job
            Run for every 2 hour period is copied.
        periodicity (PeriodicitySnapshotReplicationCopyPolicyEnum): Specifies
            the frequency that Snapshots should be copied to the specified
            target. Used in combination with multipiler. 'kEvery' means that
            the Snapshot copy occurs after the number of Job Runs equals the
            number specified in the multiplier. 'kHour' means that the
            Snapshot copy occurs hourly at the frequency set in the
            multiplier, for example if multiplier is 2, the copy occurs every
            2 hours. 'kDay' means that the Snapshot copy occurs daily at the
            frequency set in the multiplier. 'kWeek' means that the Snapshot
            copy occurs weekly at the frequency set in the multiplier.
            'kMonth' means that the Snapshot copy occurs monthly at the
            frequency set in the multiplier. 'kYear' means that the Snapshot
            copy occurs yearly at the frequency set in the multiplier.
        target (ReplicationTargetSettings): Specifies the replication target
            to copy the Snapshots to.
