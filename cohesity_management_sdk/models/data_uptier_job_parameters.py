class DataUptierJobParameters(object):

    """Implementation of the 'DataUptierJobParameters' model.

    Data Uptier Job Parameters.

    Attributes:
    file_selection_policy (FileSelectionPolicyEnum): Specifies policy to
        select a file to uptier based on file access or modification time.
        eg. A file can be selected to uptier if it has been accessed in the
        HotFileWindow or it is modified.
        enum: kLastAccessed, kLastModified.
        Specifies policy for file selection in data uptier jobs.
        'kLastAccessed': Uptier the files which are accessed for at least
        num_file_access in hot_file_window.
        'kLastModified': Uptier the files which are modified.
    file_size_bytes (int): Gives the size criteria to be used for selecting the
        files to be uptiered in bytes. The hot files that are smaller or
        greater than this size are uptiered.
    file_size_policy (FileSizePolicyEnum): Specifies policy to select a file
        to uptier based on its size.
        eg. A file can be selected to uptier if its size is greater than or
        smaller than the FileSizeBytes.
        enum: kGreaterThan, kSmallerThan.
        Specifies policy for file selection in data uptier jobs based on
        file size.
        'kGreaterThan': Uptier the files having size greater than file_size.
        'kSmallerThan': Uptier the files having size smaller than file_size.
    hot_file_window (int): Identifies the hot files in the NAS source. Files
        that have been modified in the last hot_file_window are uptiered.
        Applicable only when file_select_policy is kLastAccessed.
    include_all_files (bool): Specifies whether uptier all files found in the
        view by overriding the FileUptierSelectionPolicy &
        FileUptierSizePolicy constraints. Default value false.
    nfs_mount_path (string): Mount path where the Cohesity target view is
        mounted on NFS clients while migrating the data.
    num_file_access (int): Number of times file must be accessed within
        hot_file_window in order to qualify for uptiering. Applicable only
        when file_select_policy is kLastAccessed.
    source_view_name (string): The source view name from which the data will
        be uptiered.
