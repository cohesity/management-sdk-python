        days (list of DayEnum): Array of Week Days.  Specifies a list of days
            of a week (such as 'kSunday') when the time period should be
            applied. If not set, the time range applies to all days of the
            week. Specifies a day in a week such as 'kSunday', 'kMonday',
            etc.
        end_time (TimeOfDay): Specifies the end time for the daily time
            period.

        start_time (TimeOfDay): Specifies the start time for the daily time
            period.
