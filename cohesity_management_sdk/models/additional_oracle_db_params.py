    Attributes:
        app_entity_id (long|int): Database app id.
        db_info_channel_vec (list of OracleDBChannelInfo): The following proto
            message should be renamed to a more general message to represent
            parameters pertaining to a single unique Oracle database.
            Uniqueness of an Oracle database should be strictly determined by
            its database unique name. i.e. all backup parameters needed for a
            unique Oracle database should be expressed in the following proto.
            It is a vector for future support of backing up Data Guard
            sources. We may or may not need this to be vector to support Data
            Guard sources. For now, the size of this vector is always 1. When
            we rename this proto in the future, if we determine there is no
            need to use a vector for Data Guard support, we can choose to
            remove 'repeated'.
