        code (string):  The code of the mapper in the specified language.
            Should be UTF-8.
        id (int): Mapper ID generated by system. Absent when user is creating
            a new mapper. Mandatory in all other use cases.
        is_system_defined (bool): Whether the mapper is system defined.
        jar_name (string): User can write their own mapper/reducer or
            upload jar files containing mappers and reducers. If this mapper
            was part of a jar file, then this field will have the JAR name.
        jar_path (string): path of JAR in which this mapper was found. This
            is applicable only when this mapper was uploaded via JAR.
        language (int): Language of the mapper.
