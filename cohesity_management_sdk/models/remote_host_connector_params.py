    Contains parameters to connect to a remote host.

    Attributes:
        credentials (Credentials): Credentials that will be used to login to
            the remote host. For env of type kLinux, it is expected that user
            has setup the password-less access to the remote host. So only
            username field MUST be specified.
        host_address (string): Address (i.e., IP, hostname or FQDN) of the
            host to connect to. Magneto will connect using ssh or equivalent
            to the host.
        host_type (int): Execution status of the host_address.
