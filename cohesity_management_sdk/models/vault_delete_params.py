        force_delete (bool): Specifies whether to force delete the vault. If
            the flag is set to true, the RemovalState of the vault is changed

        id (int|long): Specifies an id that identifies the Vault.
        include_marked_for_removal (bool): Specifies if Vaults that are marked
            for removal should be returned.
        retry (bool): Specifies whether to retry a request after failure.
