class UsageAndPerformanceStats(object):

    """Implementation of the 'UsageAndPerformanceStats' model.

    Provides usage and performance statistics
    for entities such as a disks, Nodes or Clusters.

    Attributes:
        data_in_bytes (long|int): Specifies the data read from the protected
            objects by the Cohesity Cluster before any data reduction using
            deduplication and compression.
        data_in_bytes_after_reduction (long|int): Morphed Usage before data is
            replicated to other nodes as per RF or Erasure Coding policy.
        min_usable_physical_capacity_bytes (long|int): Specifies the minimum
            usable capacity available after erasure coding or RF. This will
            only be populated for cluster. If a cluster has multiple Domains
            (View Boxes) with different RF or erasure coding, this metric will
            be computed using the scheme that will provide least saving.
        num_bytes_read (long|int): Provides the total number of bytes read in
            the last 30 seconds.
        num_bytes_written (long|int): Provides the total number of bytes
            written in the last 30 second.
        physical_capacity_bytes (long|int): Provides the total physical
            capacity in bytes of all the storage devices, after subtracting
            space reserved for cluster services
        read_ios (long|int): Provides the number of Read IOs that occurred in
            the last 30 seconds.
        read_latency_msecs (float): Provides the Read latency in milliseconds
            for the Read IOs that occurred during the last 30 seconds.
        system_capacity_bytes (long|int): Provides the total available
            capacity as computed by the Linux 'statfs' command.
        system_usage_bytes (long|int): Provides the usage of bytes, as
            computed by the Linux 'statfs' command, after the size of the data
            is reduced by change-block tracking, compression and
            deduplication.
        total_physical_raw_usage_bytes (long|int): Provides the usage of
            bytes, as computed by the Cohesity Cluster, before the size of the
            data is reduced by change-block tracking, compression and
            deduplication.
        total_physical_usage_bytes (long|int): Provides the data stored
            locally, after the data has been reduced by deduplication and
            compression, including the space required for honoring the
            resiliency settings (EC/RF).
        write_ios (long|int): Provides the number of Write IOs that occurred
            in the last 30 seconds.
        write_latency_msecs (float): Provides the Write latency in
            milliseconds for the Write IOs that occurred during the last 30
            seconds.
