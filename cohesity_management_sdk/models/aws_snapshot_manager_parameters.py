    Protection Job parameters applicable to 'kAWSSnapshotManager' Environment
    type.
    Specifies additional job parameters applicable for 'kAWSSnapshotManager'
    Environment type Protection Sources in a Protection Job.

    Attributes:
        ami_creation_frequency (int): Specifies the frequency of AMI creation.
            This should be set if the option to create AMI is set. A value of
            n creates an AMI from the snapshots after every n runs. eg. n = 2
            implies every alternate backup run starting from the first will
            create an AMI.
        create_ami (bool): If true, creates an AMI after taking snapshots of
            the instance. It should be set only while backing up EC2
            instances. CreateAmi creates AMI for the protection job.
