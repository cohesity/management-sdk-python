        encryption_key (string): If set, user has encrypted the credential with
            'user_ecryption_key'. It is assumed that credentials are first
            encrypted using internal magento key and then encrypted using user
            encryption key.
        has_persistent_agent (bool): Set this to true if a persistent agent is
            running on the host. If this is specified, then credentials would
            not be used to log into the host environment. This mechanism may
            be used in environments such as VMware to get around UAC
            permission issues by running the agent as a service with the right
            credentials. If this field is not specified, credentials must be
            specified.
        is_internal_encrypted (bool): Set to true if credentials are encrypted
            by internal magneto key.
