class CopySnapshotTaskStatus(object):

    """Implementation of the 'CopySnapshotTaskStatus' model.

    Specifies the status of the copy task that copies the snapshot of a
    Protection Source object to a target.

    Attributes:
        error (string): Specifies if an error occurred (if any) while running
            this task. This field is populated when the status is equal to
            'kFailure'.
        source (ProtectionSource): Specifies a generic structure that
            represents a node in the Protection Source tree. Node details will
            depend on the environment of the Protection Source.
        stats (CopyRunStats): Stats for one copy task or aggregated stats of a
            Copy Run in a Protection Job Run.
        status (StatusCopySnapshotTaskStatusEnum): Specifies the status of the
            source object being protected. 'kAccepted' indicates the task is
            queued to run but not yet running. 'kRunning' indicates the task
            is running. 'kCanceling' indicates a request to cancel the task
            has occurred but the task is not yet canceled. 'kCanceled'
            indicates the task has been canceled. 'kSuccess' indicates the
            task was successful. 'kFailure' indicates the task failed.
            'kWarning' indicates the task has finished with warning.
            'kOnHold' indicates the task is kept onHold.
            'kMissed' indicates the task is missed.
        task_end_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the end time of the copy
            task. The end time is specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in
            microseconds).
        task_start_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time of the copy
            task. The start time is specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in
            microseconds). Copy run task is started after completing backup
            tasks. It may spawn sub-tasks to copy or replicate individual
            snapshots.
