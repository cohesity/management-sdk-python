    """Implementation of the 'AppInstance' model.

    AppInstance provides application instance's information.

    Attributes:
        app_access_token (string): Specifies the token to access with the app.
        app_instance_id (long|int): Specifies unique id across all instances
            of all apps.
        app_name (string): Specifies name of the app that is launched in this
            instance.
        app_uid (long|int): Specifies id of the app that is launched in this
            instance.
        app_version (long|int): Specifies the version of the app that is
            launched in this instance.
        created_time_usecs (long |int): Specifies timestamp (in microseconds)
            when the app instance was first created.
        creation_uid (string): Specifies a unique identifier generated by the
            client to let the backend identify retries of the app launch
            request. type: string
        description (string): Specifies user configured description for the
            app instance.
        dev_version (string):Specifies version of the app provided by the
            developer.
        duration_usecs (long|int):  Specifies duration (in microseconds) for
            which the app instance
        health_detail (string): Specifies the reason the app instance is
            unhealthy. Only set if app instance is unhealthy.
        health_status (int|long): Specifies the current health status of the
            app instance.
        https_ui (bool): Specifies app ui http config. If set to true, the
            App's UI uses https. Otherwise it uses http.
        node_ip (string): Specifies the ip of the node which can be used to
            contact app instance external services.
        node_port (long|int): Specifies the node port on which the app
            instance services external requests.
        settings (AppInstanceSettings): Specifies settings used to launch an
            app instance.
        state (StateAppInstanceEnum):
            Specifies the current state of the app instance.
            Specifies operational status of an app instance.
            kInitializing - The app instance has been launched or resumed, but
            is not fully running yet.
            kRunning - The app instance is running. Check health_status for
            the actual health.
            kPausing - The app instance is being paused.
            kPaused - The app instance has been paused.
            kTerminating - The app instance is being terminated.
            kTerminated -  The app instance has been terminated.
            kFailed - The app instance has failed due to an unrecoverable
            error.
        state_detail (string): Specifies the failure reason when the app
            instance's state is kFailed.
        user_ssh_key (UserSshKey): Specifies username and corresponding ssh
            key to be inserted into the VMs.
        vm_groups (list of VmGroup):  Specifies list of all VM groups for this
            application. Each VM group contains a list of VMs. Information
            needed for UI like the nodePort, the port type etc. is stored for
            each VM.
