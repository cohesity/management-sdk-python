class DeviceTree(object):

    """Implementation of the 'DeviceTree' model.

    A logical volume is built on a tree where leaves are the slices of
    partitions (PartitionSlice) defined below and intermediate nodes are
    assembled by combining nodes in some mode (linear layout, striped,
    mirrored,
    RAID etc).
    A DeviceTree is a block device formed by combining one or more Devices
    using a combining strategy.

    Attributes:
        child_vec (list of DeviceTreeChildDevice): TODO: type description
            here.
        device_id (int): Internal device identifier of the device to be
            activated as a thin volume.
        device_length (long|int): The length of this device. This should match
            the length which is computable based on children and combining
            strategy.  e.g. if there is only one partition slice in an LVM
            volume, 'length' in the partition slice is equal to
            'device_length'.
        stripe_size (int): In case data is striped, this represents the length
            of the stripe. The number of stripes is defined by the size of
            child_vec above.
        thin_pool_chunk_size (int): Chunk size. Only populated if device type is
            thin pool.
        mtype (int): How to combine the children.
