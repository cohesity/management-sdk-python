class EntitySchemaProto_Granularity(object):

    """Implementation of the 'EntitySchemaProto_Granularity' model.

    Rolling up or Down sampling is performed on timeseries data to reduce
    space usage by timeseries. Rollup Granularity is defined per entity
    schema but rollup function is not defined. Instead we create rolledup
    values for all the rollup functions.

    Attributes:
        rollup_interval_secs (int): Defines the rollup interval or a bucket
            size. All data points within one time bucket are rolled up to one
            summary data point using the defined rollup function. For example,
            say, raw metric is published at ~30 secs granularity. To generate
            a hourly or a daily summary time series, client can define rolled
            up metrics having interval 3600 secs and 86400 secs respectively.
        time_to_live_secs (int): Defines the duration for which the rolled up
            data is to be stored. Once the lifespan has elapsed, expired data
            is garbage collected.
