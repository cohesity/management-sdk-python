class DataMigrationJobParameters(object):

    """Implementation of the 'DataMigrationJobParameters' model.

    Specifies parameters applicable for data migration jobs in NAS
    environment.

    Attributes:
        cold_file_window (long|int): Identifies the cold files in the NAS
            source. Files that haven't been accessed/modified in the last
            cold_file_window are migrated.
        delete_orphan_data (bool): Delete migrated data if no symlink
            at source is pointing to it.
        file_path_filter (FilePathFilter): Specifies filters to match files
            and directories on a Server. Two kinds of filters are supported.
            a) prefix which always starts with '/'. b) posix which always
            starts with '*' (cannot be "*" only). Regular expressions are not
            supported. If a directory is matched, the action is applicable to
            all of its descendants. File paths not matching any protectFilters
            are not backed up.  An example is: Protect Filters: "/" Exclude
            Filters: "/tmp", "*.mp4" Using such a policy will include
            everything under the root directory except the /tmp directory and
            all the mp4 files.
        file_selection_policy (FileSelectionPolicyEnum): Specifies policy to
            select a file to migrate based on its creation, last access or
            modification time. eg. A file can be selected to migrate if it has
            not been accessed/modified in the ColdFileWindow. enum:
            kOlderThan, kLastAccessed, kLastModified. Specifies policy for
            file selection in data migration jobs based on time. 'kOlderThan':
            Migrate the files that are older than cold file window.
            'kLastAccessed': Migrate the files that are not accessed in cold
            file window. 'kLastModified': Migrate the files that have not been
            modified in cold file window.
        file_size_bytes (long|int): Gives the size criteria to be used for
            selecting the files to be migrated in bytes. The cold files that
            are equal and greater than this size are migrated.
        file_size_policy (FileSizePolicyEnum): Specifies policy to select a
            file to migrate based on its size. eg. A file can be selected to
            migrate if its size is greater than or smaller than the
            FileSizeBytes. enum: kGreaterThan, kSmallerThan. Specifies policy
            for file selection in data migration jobs based on file size.
            'kGreaterThan': Migrate the files whose size are greater than
            specified file size. 'kSmallerThan': Migrate the files whose size
            are smaller than specified file size.
        migrate_without_stub (bool): Specifies if data is to be migrated
            without stub.
        nfs_mount_path (string): Mount path where the target view must be
            mounted on all NFS clients for accessing the migrated data.
        target_view_name (string): The target view name to which the data will
            be migrated.
