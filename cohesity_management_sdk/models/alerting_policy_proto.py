    """Implementation of the 'AlertingPolicyProto' model.

    TODO: type model description here.

    Attributes:
        delivery_target_vec (list of DeliveryRuleProtoDeliveryTarget): The
            delivery targets to be alerted.
        emails (list of string): The email addresses to send alerts to. This
            field has been deprecated in favor of the field
            delivery_target_vec. The clients should take care to ensure that
            the emails stored in here are migrated to that field, or else
            utilise both the fields when trying to obtain the complete list of
            delivery targets.
        policy (int): 'policy' is declared as int32 because ORing the enums
            will generate values which are invalid as enums. Protobuf doesn't
            allow those invalid enums to be set.
        raise_object_level_failure_alert (bool): Raise per object alert for
            failures.
