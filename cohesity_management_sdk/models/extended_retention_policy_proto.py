class ExtendedRetentionPolicyProto(object):

    """Implementation of the 'ExtendedRetentionPolicyProto' model.

    Message that specifies additional retention policies to apply to backup
    snapshots.


    Attributes:

        backup_type (int): The backup type to which this extended retention
            applies to. If this is not set, the extended retention will be
            applicable to all non-log backup types.  Currently, the only value
            that can be set here is kFull (Magneto will return an error if it
            is set to anything else).
        copy_partially_successful_run (bool): If this is false, then only
            snapshots from the first completely successful run in the given
            time granularity will be considered eligible for this extended
            retention policy. If this is true, then snapshots from the first
            partially successful run will also be considered eligible.
        granularity_bucket (GranularityBucket): The granularity bucket
            frequency which determines the backup snapshots that this extended
            retention policy applies to.
        id (string): This id uniquely identifies this entry in the
            ProtectionPolicyProto.  If this message is from global policy, this
            id is generated by Helios. Otherwise, it is generated by Iris.
            Magneto treats this as an opaque identifier.
        retention_policy (RetentionPolicyProto): The retention that applies to
            the backup snapshots matched by the above granularity bucket.
