        hosts_info_list (list of HostInfo): Specifies the list of all hosts on
            which the certificate is to be deployed.
        mtype (TypeDeployCertParametersEnum): Specifies the type of the host
            such as 'kSapHana', 'kSapOracle', etc. Specifies the host type of
            host for generating and deploying a Certificate. 'kOther'
            indicates it is any of the other hosts. 'kSapOracle' indicates it
            is a SAP Oracle host. 'kSapHana' indicates it is a SAP HANA host.
