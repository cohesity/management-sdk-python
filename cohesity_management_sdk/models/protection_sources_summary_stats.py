class ProtectionSourcesSummaryStats(object):

    """Implementation of the 'ProtectionSourcesSummaryStats' model.

    Specifies Job Run (Snapshot) summary statistics about the specified
    leaf Protection Source Object (such as a VM).

    Attributes:
        first_failed_run_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time of
            the first failed Job Run protecting this Protection Source Object.
            The time is specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in
            microseconds).
        first_successful_run_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time
            of the first successful Job Run protecting this Protection Source
            Object. The time is specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in
            microseconds).
        last_failed_run_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time of the
            last failed Job Run protecting this Protection Source Object. The
            time is specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in microseconds).
        last_run_end_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the end time of the last
            Job Run protecting this Protection Source Object. The time is
            specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in microseconds).
        last_run_error_msg (string): Specifies the error message associated
            with last run, if the last run has failed.
        last_run_start_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time of the
            last Job Run protecting this Protection Source Object. The time is
            specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in microseconds).
        last_run_status (LastRunStatusEnum): Specifies the Job Run status of
            the last Job Run protecting this Protection Source Object.
            'kSuccess' indicates that the Job Run was successful. 'kRunning'
            indicates that the Job Run is currently running. 'kWarning'
            indicates that the Job Run was successful but warnings were
            issued. 'kCancelled' indicates that the Job Run was canceled.
            'kError' indicates the Job Run encountered an error and did not
            run to completion.
        last_run_type (LastRunTypeEnum): Specifies the Job Run type of the
            last Job Run protecting this Protection Source Object. 'kRegular'
            indicates an incremental (CBT) backup. Incremental backups
            utilizing CBT (if supported) are captured of the target protection
            objects. The first run of a kRegular schedule captures all the
            blocks. 'kFull' indicates a full (no CBT) backup. A complete
            backup (all blocks) of the target protection objects are always
            captured and Change Block Tracking (CBT) is not utilized. 'kLog'
            indicates a Database Log backup. Capture the database transaction
            logs to allow rolling back to a specific point in time. 'kSystem'
            indicates system volume backup. It produces an image for bare
            metal recovery.
        last_successful_run_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time of
            the last successful Job Run protecting this Protection Source
            Object. The time is specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in
            microseconds).
        num_data_read_bytes (long|int): Specifies the total number of bytes
            read while protecting this Protection Source Object.
        num_errors (int): Specifies the total number of errors reported during
            Job Runs of this Protection Source Object.
        num_logical_bytes_protected (long|int): Specifies the total logical
            bytes protected for this Protection Source Object. The logical
            size is when the data is fully hydrated or expanded.
        num_snapshots (int): Specifies the total number of Snapshots that are
            backing up this Protection Source Object.
        num_success_runs (int): Specifies the total number of successful Job
            Runs protecting this Protection Source Object.
        num_warnings (int): Specifies the total number of warnings reported
            during Job Runs of this Protection Source Object.
        protection_source (ProtectionSource): Specifies the leaf Protection
            Source Object (such as VM). Snapshot summary statistics are
            reported for this Protection Source Object.
        registered_source (string): Specifies the name of the Registered
            Source that is the top level parent of the specified Protection
            Source Object.
        tenants (list of TenantInfo): Specifies basic information about
            tenants having access to the protection job.
