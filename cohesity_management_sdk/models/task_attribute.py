            be casted to the type indicated here. 'kInt64' indicates that the
            value stored in the Task Attribute is a 64-bit integer. 'kDouble'
            indicates that the value stored in the Task Attribute is a 64 bit
            floating point number. 'kString' indicates that the value stored
            in the Task Attribute is a string. 'kBytes' indicates that the
