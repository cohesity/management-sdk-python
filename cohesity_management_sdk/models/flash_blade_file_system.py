class FlashBladeFileSystem(object):

    """Implementation of the 'FlashBladeFileSystem' model.

    Specifies information about a Flash Blade File System in a Storage Array.

    Attributes:
        backup_enabled (bool): Specifies whether the .snapshot directory
            exists on the file system. Backup is enabled only if the directory
            exists.
        created_time_msecs (long|int): Specifies the time when the filesystem
            was created in Unix epoch time in milliseconds.
        logical_capacity_bytes (long|int): Specifies the total capacity in
            bytes of the file system.
        logical_used_bytes (long|int): Specifies the size of logical data
            currently represented on the file system in bytes.
        nfs_info (FlashBladeNfsInfo): Specifies information specific to NFS
            protocol exposed by Pure Flash Blade file system.
        physical_used_bytes (long|int): Specifies the size of physical data
            currently consumed by the file system. This includes the space
            used for the snapshots.
        protocols (list of ProtocolFlashBladeFileSystemEnum): List of
            Protocols.  Specifies the list of protocols enabled on the file
            system. 'kNfs' indicates NFS exports are supported on Pure
            FlashBlade File System. 'kCifs2' indicates CIFS/SMB Shares are
            supported on Pure FlashBlade File System. 'kHttp' indicates object
            protocol over HTTP and HTTPS are supported.
        unique_used_bytes (long|int): Specifies the size of physical data
            consumed by the file system itself not including the size of the
            snapshots.
