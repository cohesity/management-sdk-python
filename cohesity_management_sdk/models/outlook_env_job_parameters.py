    """Implementation of the 'OutlookEnvJobParameters' model.

    Specifies Outlook job parameters applicable for all Office365 Environment
    type Protection Sources in a Protection Job.

    Attributes:
        file_path_filter (FilePathFilter): Specifies filters to match files
            and directories on a Server. Two kinds of filters are supported.
            a) prefix which always starts with '/'. b) posix which always
            starts with '*' (cannot be "*" only). Regular expressions are not
            supported. If a directory is matched, the action is applicable to
            all of its descendants. File paths not matching any protectFilters
            are not backed up.  An example is: Protect Filters: "/" Exclude
            Filters: "/tmp", "*.mp4" Using such a policy will include
            everything under the root directory except the /tmp directory and
            all the mp4 files.
        should_backup_mailbox (bool): Specifies whether mailbox of each
            Office365 Users/Groups within the job, should be backed up or
            not.
