    """Implementation of the 'VlanParameters' model.

    Specifies VLAN parameters for the restore operation.

    Attributes:
        disable_vlan (bool): Specifies whether to use the VIPs even when VLANs
            are configured on the Cluster. If configured, VLAN IP addresses
            are used by default. If VLANs are not configured, this flag is
            ignored. Set this flag to true to force using the partition VIPs
            when VLANs are configured on the Cluster.
        interface_name (string): Specifies the physical interface group name
            to use for mounting Cohesity's view on the remote host. If
            specified, Cohesity hostname or the IP address on this VLAN is
            used.
        vlan (int): Specifies the VLAN to use for mounting Cohesity's view on
            the remote host. If specified, Cohesity hostname or the IP address
            on this VLAN is used.
