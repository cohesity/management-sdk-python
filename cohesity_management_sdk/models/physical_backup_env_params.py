class PhysicalBackupEnvParams(object):

    """Implementation of the 'PhysicalBackupEnvParams' model.

    Message to capture any additional backup params for a Physical
    environment.

    Attributes:
        enable_incremental_backup_after_restart (bool): If this is set to
            true, then incremental backup will be performed after the server
            restarts, otherwise a full-backup will be done. NOTE: This is
            applicable to windows host environments.
        filtering_policy (FilteringPolicyProto): Proto to encapsulate the
            filtering policy for backup objects like files or directories. If
            an object is not matched by any of the 'allow_filters', it will be
            excluded in the backup. If an object is matched by one of the
            'deny_filters', it will always be excluded in the backup.
            Basically 'deny_filters' overwrite 'allow_filters' if they both
            match the same object. Currently we only support two kinds of
            filter: prefix which always starts with '/', or postfix which
            always starts with '*' (cannot be "*" only). We don't support
            regular expression right now. A concrete example is: Allow
            filters: "/" Deny filters: "/tmp", "*.mp4" Using such a policy
            will include everything under the root directory except the /tmp
            directory and all the mp4 files.
