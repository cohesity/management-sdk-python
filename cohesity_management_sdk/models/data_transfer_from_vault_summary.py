    """Implementation of the 'DataTransferFromVaultSummary' model.

    Specifies summary statistics about the transfer of data from a Vault
    to this Cohesity Cluster.

    Attributes:
        data_transfer_per_task (list of DataTransferFromVaultPerTask): Array
            of Data Transferred Per Task.  Specifies the transfer of data from
            this Vault to this Cohesity Cluster for each clone or recover
            task.
        num_logical_bytes_transferred (long|int): Specifies the total number
            of logical bytes that have been transferred from this Vault
            (External Target) to this Cohesity Cluster. The logical size is
            when the data is fully hydrated or expanded.
        num_physical_bytes_transferred (long|int): Specifies the total number
            of physical bytes that have been transferred from this Vault
            (External Target) to the Cohesity Cluster.
        num_tasks (long|int): Specifies the number of recover or clone tasks
            that have transferred data from this Vault (External Target) to
            this Cohesity Cluster.
        physical_data_transferred_bytes_during_time_range (list of long|int):
            Array of Physical Data Transferred Per Day.  Specifies the
            physical data transferred from this Vault to the Cohesity Cluster
            during the time period specified using the startTimeMsecs and
            endTimeMsecs parameters. For each day in the time period, an array
            element is returned, for example if 7 days are specified, 7 array
            elements are returned.
        vault_name (string): Specifies the name of the Vault (External
            Target).
